# Measurement standardization handoff

Continue on `measuremnt-standarization`. Checkpoint 11c review fixes are complete;
the next task is **checkpoint 12 only: rewrite the developer guide against the
implemented engine**. Validate runnable examples, run relevant checks, and commit
checkpoint 12 separately before starting the IV migration in checkpoint 13.

## Corrections already implemented

- Bundle publication keeps original side-artifact staging files until the completed
  CSV succeeds. A failed CSV publication leaves recoverable raw data. Rollback
  checks the published file identity before deletion and reports cleanup failures.
- Reservations contain full run IDs and unique claim IDs. Release verifies the
  claim; an old reservation cannot delete a replacement owner's marker.
- Publication, reservation reuse, and cleanup use exclusive guard files. An
  abandoned `.res.lock` blocks that candidate; do not automatically delete it.
  Inspect and explicitly remove such locks only after confirming no writer is active.
- `stale_age_seconds` only permits reuse of the explicitly named run's marker.
  Age alone never authorizes taking a foreign run's reservation. Cleanup requires
  `owner_uuid`; omission does nothing. Partial cleanup also validates the CSV's
  run ID and partial flag. Unknown or foreign files are retained.
- Cross-volume fallback reuses the bundle's existing reservation. The POSIX
  fallback still fails safely if no no-replace primitive is available.
- Partial metadata is validated before allocating staging. Replacing a checkpoint
  requires matching ownership metadata. Replacement failures retain/report the
  new staging file and preserve the previous checkpoint.

## Shared engine persistence API to document

`BaseMeasurement` accepts keyword arguments `output_dir`, `measurement_schema`,
`column_units`, optional `raw_column_units`, and optional `metadata`.
No persistence configuration is needed for `save=False`. Saving requires explicit
configuration; the engine no longer reports a virtual path as a successful save.

For example, a subclass for IV data can initialize the shared engine with:

```python
super().__init__(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    measurement_schema="iv_sweep",
    column_units={"voltage": "V", "current": "A"},
    metadata={"sample": sample_name},
)
```

The engine generates required lifecycle metadata and uses plain column names with
JSON unit metadata. `raw_column_units` describes partial data when its columns
differ from analyzed results. Full runs and sessions both use real filesystem
publication. Aborted/failed partials record their actual outcome; they never set
`filename`. Completed filenames are assigned only after successful publication.

Families producing plots override `_stage_side_artifacts(data, request,
reservation)` to return `(staging_path, target_path)` pairs. Targets must be in the
reserved destination and begin with `reservation.candidate_basename + "_"`.
Use run-owned hidden staging names; preserve raw data in memory. If staging itself
fails, attach any recovery paths to the exception. Do not override the shared
publication mechanism just to implement plots.

Save errors preserve in-memory raw data and expose `recoverable_staging_paths`
on the exception and measurement, and in `RunRecord.metadata`. The standalone
`write_partial_csv` helper supports intentional updates to an owned checkpoint.
Do not describe automatic periodic checkpoint scheduling as implemented.

## Verification and boundaries

The full repository suite passed: **1147 passed, 1 skipped, 2 xfailed**.
Sixteen new recovery/engine regressions cover the reviewed failures, actual
completed and partial CSVs for runs and sessions, and failed-save recovery.
The opt-in real SMB test remains skipped; cross-volume behavior was fault-injected.
No physical hardware or SMB deployment validation is claimed.

Measurement-family migrations remain in their planned checkpoints. Preserve the
user's decisions: plain columns, units in metadata, standardized APIs throughout,
and no legacy argument adapters or compatibility shims.
